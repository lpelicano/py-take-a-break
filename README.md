# Take a Break (v1.0) - A simple script when running forces you to take a break.

## Quick run down - 
This script will, after every 30 minutes, play a music video to remind you that it is time to take a break. This will occur 6 times before the script terminates.

## Requirements -
This script is made with ***python 2.7***.

## Modules used -
`webbrowser`
`time`


## Future tasks -
- Develop GUI for v2.0
- Customisable break intervals
- Turn into fully fledged application that is easily executable
